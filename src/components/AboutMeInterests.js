      Coldplay, Linkin Park, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Kygo and Two Door Cinema Club.`

      description:  <>
      I decided to include React as part of my interests because it's something I enjoy learning. I learned 
      a little bit at CGI when I was asked to do some forms, even though I had no experience in frontend 
      development. I then decided to learn more and took a paid course about it. That's when my passion for 
      frontend started! <br/><br/>I built a lot of small apps during that course and decided to build this page 
      about myself using React and created most of the dynamic components you see on this page. It was a lot of fun!
